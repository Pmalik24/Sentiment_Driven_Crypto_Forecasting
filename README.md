# Sentiment Driven Crypto Forecasting

## Overview

This project explores the integration of sentiment analysis with cryptocurrency valuation models. It aims to understand how investor attention and general sentiment, derived from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, impact cryptocurrency prices. 

## Objectives

- Analyze the influence of social sentiment on cryptocurrency valuation.
- Leverage FinBERT for sentiment analysis and ARIMAX for time series analysis.
- Conduct a parallel study using the Random Forest model for comprehensive insights.

## Methodology

1. **Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT**: Utilizing the FinBERT model for initial sentiment labeling of social media posts.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: Implementing ARIMA models to understand and predict cryptocurrency price movements.
3. **Parallel Study with Random Forest**: Analyzing the impact of sentiment on crypto prices using Random Forest.

## Significance

This project aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of cryptocurrency valuation, beyond traditional methods, by incorporating public sentiment and various statistical approaches.
